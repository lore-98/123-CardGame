# 1-2-3 Card Game

## Description
"1-2-3 Card Game" is an exciting card game fully implemented in C++, based on a simple yet engaging solitary gameplay mechanic. Players challenge luck and strategy by shuffling a deck of 52 cards and attempting to complete the cycle without encountering fatal matches that force them to start over.

### How to Play
The gameplay proceeds with the player (simulated by the computer) shuffling a deck of 52 cards, drawing them one by one, and announcing "one," "two," "three" in sequence. If the numerical value of the drawn card matches the announced number, the game is lost, and the player must start over. The goal is to manage to complete the entire deck without mismatches.

## Game Modes
The project offers two modes:
1. **Visual Mode**: A slowed-down version that allows observing the gameplay, with the computer announcing the number and drawing the card visually.
2. **Simulation Mode**: A mode that instantly simulates multiple games, providing statistics on how many attempts are needed before achieving a win.
